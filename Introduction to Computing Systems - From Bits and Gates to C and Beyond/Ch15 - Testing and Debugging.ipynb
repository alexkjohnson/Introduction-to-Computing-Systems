    "Testing is the process of exposing bugs, and debugging is the process of fixing them\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing a piece of code involves subjecting it to as many input conditions as possible, in order to stress the software into revealing its bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging code is significantly easier if you know how to gather information about the bug - such as the value of key variables during the execution of the program—in a systematic way\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we describe several techniques you can use to find and fix bugs within a program\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15.2 Types of Errors \n",
    "- syntactic\n",
    "- semantic - the program is syntactically correct but does not behave exactly as we expected\n",
    "- algorithmic - approach to solving a problem is wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.2.2 Semantic Errors \n",
    "do not involve incorrect syntax; therefore, the program gets translated and we are able to execute it. It is not until we analyze the output that we discover that the program is not performing as expected\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all computer systems have safeguards that prevent\n",
    "a program from performing actions that might affect other unrelated programs.\n",
    "For instance, it is undesirable for a user's program to modify the memory that\n",
    "stores the operating system or to write a control register that might affect other\n",
    "programs, such as a control register that causes the computer to shut down. When\n",
    "such an illegal action is performed by a program, the operating system terminates its execution and prints out a run-time error message. \n",

    "### 15.2.3 Algorithmic Errors \n",
    "result of an incorrect program design\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15.3 Testing \n",
    "What is testing? With testing, we basically put the software through trials where input patterns are applied (in order to mimic what the software might see during real operation) and the output of the program is checked for correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "**black-box testing** is used to check if a program meets its specifications, and **white-box testing** targets various facets of the program's implementation in order to provide some assurance that every line of code is tested. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.3.1 Black-Box Testing \n",
    "examine if the program meets its input and output specifications, disregarding the internals of the program\n",
    "\n",
    "we are concerned with what the program does and not how it does it\n",
    "\n",
    "For testing larger programs, the testing process is automated in order to run more tests per unit time. That is, we construct another program to automatically run the original program, provide some random inputs, check that the output meets specifications, and repeat. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to automate the black-box process, however, we need a way to automatically test whether the program's output was correct or incorrect. Here, we might need to construct a **checker program** that is different than the original program but performs a similar computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the original and checker programs had the same bug, it would go undetected by the black-box testing process. For this reason, black-box testers who write checker programs are often not permitted to see the code within the black box they are testing so that we get a truly independent version of the checker. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.3.2 White-Box Testing \n",
    "For larger software systems, black-box testing is not enough. With black-box testing, it is not possible to know which lines of code have been tested and which have not, and therefore, according to the adage stated previously, all are presumed to be buggy\n",
    "\n",
    "Software engineers supplement black-box testing with white-box tests. \n",
    "**White-box tests isolate various internal components of the software, and test whether the components conform to their intended design.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, testing to see that each function performs correctly according to the design is a white-box test. How we divide a program into functions is part of its implementation and not its specification. We can apply the same type of testing to loops and other constructs within a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "How might a white-box test be constructed? For many tests, we might need to\n",
    "modify the code itself. For example, in order to see whether a function is working\n",
    "correctly, we might add extra code to call the function a few extra times with\n",
    "different inputs and check the outputs. We might add extra printf statements to\n",
    "the code with which we can observe values of internal variables to see if things\n",
    "are working as expected. Once the code is complete and ready for release, these\n",
    "printf statements can be removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "**assertions** can be used to check whether a function returns a value within an expected range. If the return value is out of this range, an error message is displayed\n",
    "\n",
    "**A thorough testing methodology requires the use of both black-box and whitebox tests**. It is important to realize that white-box tests alone do not cover the complete functionality of the software—even if all white-box tests pass, there might be a portion of the specification that is missing. Similarly, black-box tests alone do not guarantee that every line of code is tested."

    "## 15.4 Debugging \n",
    "The key to effective debugging is being able to quickly gather relevant information that will lead to identifying the bug\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways you can gather more information in order to\n",
    "diagnose a bug, ranging from ad hoc techniques that are quick and dirty to more\n",
    "systematic techniques that involve the use of software debugging tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.4.1 Ad Hoc Techniques \n",
    "The simplest thing to do once you realize that there is a problem with your program\n",
    "is to **visually inspect the source code**. Sometimes the nature of the failure tips you\n",
    "off to the region of the code where the bug is likely to exist. This technique is fine\n",
    "if the region of source code is small and you are very familiar with the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another simple technique is to **insert statements** within the code to print out\n",
    "information during execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Large programs with intricate bugs require the use of more heavy-duty techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.4.2 Source-Level Debuggers \n",
    "A source-level debugger is a tool that allows a program to be executed in a controlled environment, where all aspects of the execution of the program can be controlled and examined by the programmer\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a debugger can allow us to execute the program one statement at a time and examine the values of variables (and memory locations and registers, if we so choose) along the way\n",
    "\n",
    "For a source-level debugger to be used on a program, the program must be compiled such that the compiler augments the executable image with enough additional information for the debugger to function properly\n",
    "\n",
    "Among other things, the debugger will need information from the compilation process in order to map every machine language instruction to its corresponding statement in the highlevel source program. The debugger also needs information about variable names and their locations in memory (i.e., the symbol table). This is required so that a programmer can examine the value of any variable within the program using its name in the source code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eg:** gdb - free source-level debugger available on most UNIX-based platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "All debuggers support a core set of necessary operations required to probe a program's execution\n",
    "\n",
    "The core debugger commands fall into two categories: those that let you control the execution of the program and those that let you examine the value of variables and memory, etc. during the execution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breakpoints \n",
    "points at which the program should be temporarily stopped so that we can examine or modify the state of the program\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful because it helps us examine the program's execution in the region of the code where the bug occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can add a breakpoint at a particular line in the source code\n",
    "or at a particular function. When execution reaches that line, program execution\n",
    "is frozen in time, and we can examine everything about that program at that\n",
    "particular instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is useful to stop at a line only if a certain condition is true. Such **conditional breakpoints** are useful for isolating specific situations in which we suspect buggy behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can set a **watchpoint** to stop the program at any point where a particular condition is true\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike breakpoints, watchpoints are not associated with any single line of the code but apply to every line. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single-Stepping \n",
    "It is often useful to proceed from a breakpoint one statement at time—a process referred to as single-stepping. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common use of single-stepping is to verify that the control flow of the\n",
    "program does what we expect. We can single-step through a loop to verify that\n",
    "it performs the correct number of iterations or we can single-step through an\n",
    "if-else to verify that we have programmed the condition correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Displaying Values \n",
    "The art of debugging is about gathering the information required to logically deduce the source of the error \n",
    "\n",
    "## 15.5 Programming for Correctness \n",
    "Knowing how to test and debug your code is a prerequisite for being a good programmer. Great programmers know how to avoid many error-causing situations in the first place. Poor programming practices cause bugs. Being aware of some defensive programming techniques can help reduce the amount of time required to get a piece of code up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we provide three general methods for catching errors even before they become errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.5.1 Nailing Down the Specification\n",
    "Many bugs arise from poor or incomplete program specifications. Specifications\n",
    "sometimes do not cover all possible operating scenarios, and thus they leave\n",
    "some conditions open for interpretation by the programmer\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.5.2 Modular Design \n",
    "The modular design concept of building a program out of simple, pretested, working components is a fundamental concept in systems design. \n",
    "\n",
    "We design not only software, but\n",
    "circuits, hardware, and various other layers of the computing system using a\n",
    "similar modular design philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15.5.3 Defensive Programming \n",
    "a short list of general defensive programming techniques that you should adopt to avoid problems with the programs you write. \n",
    "- Comment your code\n",
    "- Adopt a consistent coding style\n",
    "- Avoid assumptions\n",
    "- Avoid global variables - While some experienced programmers rely heavily on global variables, many software engineers advocate avoiding them whenever possible. Global variables can make some programming tasks easier. However, they often make code more difficult to understand, and extend, and when a bug is detected, harder to analyze\n",
    "- Rely on the compiler. Most good compilers have an option to carefully check your program for suspicious code (for example, an uninitialized variable) or commonly misapplied code constructs (for example, using the assignment operator = instead of the equality operator ==).\n",
    "    -  If you are use the gcc compiler, use `gcc -Wall` to enable all warning messages from the compiler."
